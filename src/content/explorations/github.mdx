# Github Commit Visualizer

This is a little visualization I built to show the commit history of a given Github user. It uses the Github API to fetch the commit history of a user and then renders it in a 3D scene using Three.js.

import Scene from "@/components/explorations/github/Scene";

<div className="w-full h-96 rounded-lg shadow-lg bg-slate-100 overflow-hidden">
  <Scene client:load />
</div>
