# {frontmatter.title}

First we start with a simple but _suuuper_ shiny cube just so we have something to look at. This cube is rendered using `react-three-fiber`.

import CubeScene from "@/components/explorations/dithering/CubeScene.tsx";

<div className="w-full h-96 rounded-lg shadow-lg bg-slate-100 overflow-hidden">
  <CubeScene client:load />
</div>

## Dithering

By creating a `DitheringEffect` using `postprocessing` we can apply a unique effect to the scene.

The following scene is applying a dithering shader using a Bayer matrix and with it we get the following effect:

import DitheredScene from "@/components/explorations/dithering/DitheredScene.tsx";

<div className="self-center w-full h-96 rounded-lg shadow-lg bg-slate-100 overflow-hidden">
  <DitheredScene client:load type="bayer" />
</div>

We can switch out the dithering algorithm to get a different look. For example with Atkinson-Dithering we get the distinct diagonal lines:

<div className="w-full h-96 rounded-lg shadow-lg bg-slate-100 overflow-hidden">
  <DitheredScene client:load type="atkinson" />
</div>

... or Riemersma-Dithering which gives a more low-res effect:

<div className="self-center w-full h-96 rounded-lg shadow-lg bg-slate-100 overflow-hidden">
  <DitheredScene client:load type="riemersma" />
</div>

The shader codes for the different dithering algorithms can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/LukGer/portfolio/blob/main/src/components/explorations/dithering/DitheringEffect.tsx" target="_blank">DitheringEffect.tsx</a> file.
